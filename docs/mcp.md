# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized way to represent and exchange contextual information between AI models and systems. It provides a common interface for AI models to communicate, share data, and interoperate with each other.

## Overview

At its core, MCP defines a structured way to represent context that can be consumed by various AI models. This enables:

- **Interoperability**: Different AI models can communicate using a common protocol
- **Composability**: AI models can be chained together to create more complex AI systems
- **Standardization**: A consistent way to represent data across different modalities

## Key Concepts

### Model Context

A Model Context is the fundamental unit of the MCP. It represents a piece of data along with metadata that describes how the data should be interpreted. A Model Context contains:

- **Context ID**: A unique identifier for the context
- **Context Type**: The type of data contained (e.g., text, image, audio)
- **Data**: The actual content or data
- **Metadata**: Additional information about the data
- **Model Type**: (Optional) The type of model this context is intended for

### Context Types

MCP supports various types of context:

- **TEXT**: Textual data like prompts, responses, or documents
- **IMAGE**: Visual data like photos or renderings
- **AUDIO**: Sound data like speech or music
- **NUMERIC**: Numerical data like measurements or statistics
- **CATEGORICAL**: Categorical data like classifications or labels
- **VECTOR**: Vector representations like embeddings
- **MIXED**: A combination of multiple types

### Model Types

MCP classifies AI models into several categories:

- **LANGUAGE**: Language models for text generation and understanding
- **VISION**: Computer vision models for image analysis
- **MULTIMODAL**: Models that can process multiple modalities
- **AUDIO**: Models that process audio signals
- **REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING**: RL models for decision-making
- **CUSTOM**: Custom or specialized models

## Architecture

### Context Registry

The Context Registry is a central component that manages Model Contexts. It provides:

- Registration of new contexts
- Retrieval of contexts by ID
- Listing contexts by type or other criteria
- Deletion of contexts

### Model Manager

The Model Manager is responsible for managing AI models. It:

- Registers models in the system
- Initializes models when needed
- Runs models with appropriate contexts
- Tracks model status and metadata

## Blockchain Integration

The MCP is designed to integrate with blockchain technology, particularly Solana, to provide:

- **Decentralized Model Registry**: Models can be registered on-chain
- **Token-Gated Access**: Access to models can be controlled via MCP tokens
- **Transparent Provenance**: Model usage and attribution can be tracked on-chain
- **Decentralized Governance**: Models can be governed by a decentralized community

## Example Usage

### Creating a Model Context

```python
from mcp.model_context import ContextMetadata, ContextType, ModelContext, ModelType
import time

# Create metadata
metadata = ContextMetadata(
    creation_time=time.time(),
    source="user_input",
    version="1.0",
    content_type="text/plain",
)

# Create a text context
context = ModelContext(
    context_id="example_input_123",
    context_type=ContextType.TEXT,
    data="What is the weather like today?",
    metadata=metadata,
    model_type=ModelType.LANGUAGE
)

# Convert to JSON for storage or transmission
json_data = context.to_json()

# Recreate from JSON
restored_context = ModelContext.from_json(json_data)
```

### Using the Context Registry

```python
from mcp.model_context import ContextRegistry

# Create a registry
registry = ContextRegistry()

# Register a context
registry.register(context)

# Retrieve the context
same_context = registry.get("example_input_123")

# List contexts of a specific type
text_contexts = registry.list(context_type=ContextType.TEXT)
```

### Running a Model with Context

```python
from ai.model_manager import ModelManager

# Create a model manager
manager = ModelManager()

# Register and initialize a model
model = create_default_language_model()
manager.register_model(model)
manager.initialize_model(model.model_id)

# Run the model with the context
output_context = manager.run_model(model.model_id, context)

# Process the output
response = output_context.data
print(f"Model response: {response}")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Appropriate Context Types**: Always use the most appropriate context type for your data.
2. **Include Relevant Metadata**: Provide detailed metadata to help models understand the context better.
3. **Standardize IDs**: Use a consistent naming scheme for context IDs.
4. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: When a model doesn't support a context type, provide clear error messages.
5. **Version Your Contexts**: Always include version information in your metadata.

## Future Directions

- **Enhanced Privacy**: Adding encrypted contexts for sensitive data
- **Federated Learning**: Supporting distributed training across multiple contexts
- **Multimodal Fusion**: Better support for combining multiple context types
- **Streaming Contexts**: Support for real-time streaming of context data
- **Self-Describing Models**: Models that can declare their context requirements

## Conclusion

The Model Context Protocol provides a flexible, standardized way to represent and exchange data between AI models. By adopting MCP, developers can build more interoperable, composable AI systems that can work together seamlessly across different platforms and environments.
